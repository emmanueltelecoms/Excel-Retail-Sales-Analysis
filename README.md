*A look at the interactive Excel Dashboard I built for this project.*

##  About the Project
I worked with a sales dataset from **Aurora Retail Solutions LTD** that had some missing and messy information. My job was to clean the data and find out how the business is performing across different countries.

##  Main Goals
* **Clean the Data:** Find and fix missing info to make sure the reports are correct.
* **Track Sales:** Find the best-selling locations and see how sales change over time.
* **Understand Customers:** Look at how gender and marital status affect spending.
* **Find Best Days:** Spot the busiest days to help with planning.

##  Tools I Used
* **Microsoft Excel:**
    * **Cleaning:** `COUNTIF`, `TRIM`, and `PROPER` to fix text inconsistencies.
    * **Math & Lookup:** `SUMIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, and `XLOOKUP` to pull data and calculate totals.
    * **Logic:** `IF` formulas to tag "High Value" customers who spend over $10,000.
    * **Visualization:** Built a dashboard with Bar, Line, and Donut charts to show the data clearly.



##  What I Found
1.  **Missing Data:** About **38%** of sales don't have a location listed. This means **$1.08M** in sales is "hidden" and not tracked to a country.
2.  **Top Seller:** **Lagos** is the #1 location, bringing in **$601k** (which is 35% of all known sales).
3.  **Customer Habits:** * **Fridays** are the busiest days with 84 sales.
    * **Single** customers spend more on average ($6,480) than married customers ($5,393).
    * Total spending is very close between men and women.

##  My Recommendations
* **Fix the Sales App:** Make "Location" a required field so we don't lose data on 38% of our sales.
* **Smart Marketing:** Spend more on ads for single customers since they spend more per visit.
* **Staffing:** Make sure more staff are working on **Fridays** to handle the rush.
